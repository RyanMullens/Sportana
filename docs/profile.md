Connecting People Through Sports

Our Vision
======

Our general area of interest is social networking through pickup sports.  We want our website to connect users and enable them to get out and be active playing the sports that they love (but may not always have enough people to play).

> A successful product is the result of careful consideration, passionate enthusiasm, and obsessive attention to detail.  A good idea is not enough.  A good design is not enough.  When people care about what they make--when they know it’s something that is absolutely essential to your daily life, they can make some remarkable products.  That is what I want to do.  I want my products to have meaning--I want them to be used *because* people love using them.  I want to make things that are worth making.

***Other Neat Stuff About Me***

I began my undergraduate career as an Architecture student at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston.  There I gained practical experience in my **Principles of Design** course where I developed a fluid workflow with *Adobe Creative Suite* as well as *Google Sketchup* and *AutoCad*.  These are extremely useful skills--I am now able to produce high fidelity graphics, or rapidly prototype application mockups on the fly.  The course also taught me how to critically analyze design which informs my current design process and motivation.

Another particularly impactful course I took at Wentworth was **Organizational Development and Group Dynamics**.  We focused on the formation of groups, team-building, rewards, culture, and we examined real organizations to identify strengths and weaknesses.  This was an excellent preparation for my unforeseen academic shift to Computer Science where teamwork is essential for success.

>I arrived at Umass as a undeclared major with no idea of what I wanted to do, so I took some intro level courses. One of those courses was Computer Science 121, which was my first taste of computer science. I'v been hooked ever since. Once I graduate I want to go into the industry and hopefully find a job as network administrator.

> I’ve always been that one child in my family that wanted to do bigger things, hence the reason I like big data. Understanding the psychology and sociology of humans is really my passion, and big data is one way of examining them. I knew that I’d dive towards some kind of science degree because of my logical nature and so computer science has been the perfect fit since I entered college. Currently I work for IBM and do work with databases and web development.

> I come from a family of software engineers - my mom is retired but used to work at Digital and my dad works at CA Technologies so I guess you could say my family revolves around software.  I’m in my senior year here at UMass as a Computer Science major with a concentration in Software Engineering (though also fulfilling requirements for Security & Privacy, Networking, and Software Systems).  My particular area of interest is currently in authentication but I would enjoy working anywhere in the areas I’m studying.  In terms of extracurriculars I enjoy being involved with the LRC at UMass as the Supplemental Instructor for CS 250 (Introduction to Computation) and playing pickup soccer with friends.

>I’ve always been very interested in languages and am currently attempting to learn german. In high school I never really had much luck with spanish and decided to try programming languages instead! And from that day in freshman year, I haven’t stopped programming. I have graded for cs187 and c220 and am currently a tutor for computer science classes at the LRC.

> I was always interested in computers and how they worked. In high school I started writing games for the TI calculators and have loved programming ever since. Currently I am a freelance web developer for WordPress websites, and am looking to expand my current knowledge of web systems. I am interested in pursuing a career in web development.

**Nicholas McAvoy**
>I come from a very techie family. My mother is a computer programmer, my sister runs the computer science education program at the high school she teaches at, and my brother is studying computational physics. Only my father had no interest in computer science. I have been interested in math and science all my life but I only realized I was interested in programming early in my high school career. Even though my high school didn’t have very many computer science classes and there wasn’t much not connected with the school, by the end of high school I knew I wanted to do computer science for the rest of my life.
