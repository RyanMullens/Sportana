# Sportana Overview

Sportana knows what sports you like, who you like playing with, and where you like to play.  Whether you just want some friendly competition or are looking for a formidable face-off, Sportana makes it easy to get out and get moving with people who love to play.

# Original Proposal

We provide a proposal that details the problem we intend to solve with Sportana, the description of our product, our team roles, timeline, and estimated budget.  You may find a presentation detailing the main components of our proposal in /docs/proposal/proposal.pdf and may review the full document in the proposal.md in the same folder.    

# Functional Specification

We provide a functional specification that details how Sportana will be used. The functional specification contains scenarios, a flow diagram, screen by screens, non-goals, disclamer, and a product overview to convey this information. The functional specification also contains our team members along with their roles and responibilities. You may find a presentation detailing the main components of our functional specification in /docs/fspec/fspec.pdf and may review the full document in fspec.md in the same folder.

# Design Specification

A low level design specification is provided that details the architecture of our system, the libraries that compose our infrastructure, and the intercommunication between atomic components in our system.  A high level overview discusses the general structure of Sportana, while further discussion of each critical element in the system describes code implementation and implmentation challeneges.  PDF slides can be found in /docs/low-level-design/dspec.pdf.  That directory also contains the formal .md document, dspec.md.
