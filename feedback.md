# Project 1 Feedback

Whoa, I really dig this idea! The concept of an all-inclusive physical activity social network doesn't seem to be implemented. (Here's a Geocities-y, dead, and solely running-based social network: http://www.runnerslounge.com/ ) 

I think most sports-related social networks (Fancred, Sportlobster) target the sports fan and athletic social networks (Athlinks, sidenote: do y'all see the Comic Sans on Athlinks' page or is it just me?) target the professional athlete looking to break out. There isn't a site that targets the users between these extremes, users that want to meet new people through performing some activity.

Your Trello board is quite active, which is awesome! Facebook API integration, historically, has taken a fair amount of time to implement so if you decide to use it, make sure to start early! (but it's totally worth it) 

Awesome job on Project 1, can't wait to see your future progress!

P.S. I love your logo!
