# Project 2 Feedback

I love the idea of a qualitative intelligent queuing system, chat, and the idea of a general "feedless" interface! For your chat feature, you should check out the Socket.io library, especially it's sample 6-line Hello World chat app! (http://socket.io) 

Hear me out, and I admit it is a *little* out there, but I think a graph database would be a really interesting implementation of your queue concept! Referring to your discussion on Trello regarding data with relation, if you use Neo4j, you can create players as nodes with properties (like timeliness, friendliness, competitiveness, and location) and connect nodes based on relationships such as "friends" etc. (Imagine creating a game by creating a relationship between two players like: `CREATE UNIQUE (player1: Player { competitiveness: "high", location: "Boston" })-[r:VERSUS]->(player2: Player { competitiveness: "high", location: "Boston" })`) 

Strange ideas aside, your budget breakdown is superb. In fact, I can't tell if you plan to buy that premium domain and actually launch, which I think you should! (*maybe* not spend $4,000, but definitely go live!)

Excellent work! You've been fully funded. **thumbs up**
 

# Project 1 Feedback

Whoa, I really dig this idea! The concept of an all-inclusive physical activity social network doesn't seem to be implemented. (Here's a Geocities-y, dead, and solely running-based social network: http://www.runnerslounge.com/ ) 

I think most sports-related social networks (Fancred, Sportlobster) target the sports fan and athletic social networks (Athlinks, sidenote: do y'all see the Comic Sans on Athlinks' page or is it just me?) target the professional athlete looking to break out. There isn't a site that targets the users between these extremes, users that want to meet new people through performing some activity.

Your Trello board is quite active, which is awesome! Facebook API integration, historically, has taken a fair amount of time to implement so if you decide to use it, make sure to start early! (but it's totally worth it) 

Awesome job on Project 1, can't wait to see your future progress!

P.S. I love your logo!
