1) Install postgres if you haven't already done so. Instructions for doing this on the lubuntu virtual image can be found on http://www-edlab.cs.umass.edu/cs326/weeks/w04/overview/.
If installing to a mac:
	a) Download postgres from http://postgresapp.com
	b) Adjust the path to support psql commands:
    		- export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.3/bin/
	c) To keep these settings set up a .bash_profile
   		- cd ~/
   		- touch .bash_profile
   		- echo PATH=$PATH >> .bash_profile
	d) You can now run psql and postgres commands.

2) To setup the database you need to run the db-setup script:
    - ./db-setup.sh
    - If this doesn't run then make the file executable by running
    	chmod +x db-setup.sh
    	and then run the script again.
    - If you've already created the sportana database and started to edit things in it then drop the tables you've created in psql or run the script drop-all-tables.sh, which looks for all of the tables created in the other script and drops them.
    	./drop-all-tables.sh
    	Again if this does not work try:
    		chmod +x drop-all-tables.sh
    		and then run the script again.


Notes:
- The owner of the Sportana database defaults to the current user in postgres (probably student).
